Half: An Icon Font
=============


##Why:

We created our icon fonts for the purpose of understanding exporting SVG files and how simple the act of creating your own icon fonts has become. Before, you used to have a few thousand words describing the process of building the icons. Now, all you simply have to do is use a site like [Fontastic](http://www.fontastic.me) that helps you create your own icon fonts and even map them on the site.

##How:

The process for making an icon font is relatively simple. All you have to do is forget everything you know about making shapes in illustrator. You have to think about how to make shapes and icons without using strokes and only one color. This is crucial to the success of your icons or they won't transfer to the font very well. Also, when you create the artwork you want to try and fill the artboard up as much as possible that way the transfer captures the SVG at it's largest size making it easier to scale larger or smaller. 

What I wanted to create with my font set, "Half," was an artistic or scientific approach to how we view web icons at this stage in time. Certain symbols in my set, like the map pin locator and the shopping cart, are things that are relatively new, as in the last 10 years or so. My belief in the creation of the font is that even if you only see half, we all can recognize and understand what we are reading therefore we can think of interface design in a whole different light. 

###The tools you'll need for creating an icon font:
<ul>
<li>Adobe Illustrator (or any other vector drawing program)
<li>SVG exporting options (included in Illustrator)
<li>Fontastic account
<li>Creative juices
</ul>

##Results:

Here is a link to my Fontastic [icon set](http://app.fontastic.me/#download/8qPeiBRjSCX7CEVmXFVQuC) (and you must have a Fontastic account to download from there.)

If you don't want to take that approach, in this repo there is a <strong>"fonts"</strong> folder that contains all .ttf,.otf, and .svg files for my entire font set.
